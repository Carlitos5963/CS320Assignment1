Assignment1: Each program can be compiled and can run with the linux command line. These programs are all C files.

prog1_1.c - Takes user input (up to 65 chars) and breaks them up into tokens. The token seperation is determined by spaces.

prog1_2.c - Does what program 1 does but determines whether each token is either an INT (an integer) or a STR (anything else, including doubles).

prog1_3.c - Does what program 2 does but limits the token count to 2 tokens. If there are more than 2 tokens, then an error message will print out and will have the user try again.

prog1_4.c - Does what program 3 does, but also limits a tokens size to 20 chars. If longer, then an error message will print and the user will try again.

prog1_5.c - Does what program 4 does, but the user can now type in "quit" to exit the program. The program now also requires that a user enter in a STR, followed by an INT, or else error messages will print and the user will have to try again.

prog1_6.c - Does what program 5 does, but has the program enter a single command line argument that should be an int. The int entered as the argument is the max inputs the program will take. Or the user could type "quit" to exit.

README.md - Contains short descriptions of each file in the repository.
